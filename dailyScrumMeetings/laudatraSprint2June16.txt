What did I do last time? 
  - Implemented the entire File class in collaboration with a member of the 
team as it was a very large class with lots of class specific implementation 
details involved.
  - Created appropriate CRC cards for current implemented class design of File

What do I plan to do now?
  - After some design changes, my partner and I have to overhaul our 
implementation of the File class, specifically the constructor method
- Focus on sprint 2 tasks, such as working on the pushd command and the 
mkdir command

Am I blocked on anything?
- At the moment, the entire team is discussing some details regarding 
communication between the Interpreter, Shell and the File class. 
- Until we come to a conclusive group decision regarding design such that
File will accept certain parameter types, my partner and I who have been 
assigned the same task in the sprint 2 backlog (implement File) cannot proceed
with our task
