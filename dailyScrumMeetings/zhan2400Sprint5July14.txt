What did I do last time?
  - Added cp and mv to the commandtable in interpreter class
  - Added setFileName method to the File class
  - Modified mvChildFile and mvChildDirectory in directory class
  - finished cp command

What do I plan to do now?
  - debug for cp and mv command
  - Start unit test for cp and mv command
  
Am I blocked on anything?
  - No, not right now.
