What did I do last time?
  - Started working on the implementation of the Curl class.
  - Made a list to cover all of the possible exceptions that the Curl class
    could throw.

What do I plan to do now?
  - Finish up the Curl class code, and begin running the class through its 
    courses in order to determine if any bugs are present. 
  
Am I blocked on anything?
  - No, not right now.
