what did I do last time?
	- Worked and discussed the necessary CRC cards that our group will move
	forward with
	- Started to plan the design and implementation prototype of commands that
	are assigned to me

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish the designs and possible implementation ideas for commands I am
	responsible for
	- Start writing the actual code and implement one or more commands that I
	have been assigned for

Am I blocked on anything?
	- I need other commands to locate and find a file to get my commands to
	work
	- I also need a command that can navigate into a directory in order to
	complete the functional purpose of my assigned responsibilities.
