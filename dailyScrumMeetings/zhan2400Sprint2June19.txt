What did I do last time? 
  - implemented file constructor and file creater methods in the File class
    after group discussion
  - implemented Directory class constructors, Directory class get treeNode
name method, addChildren method, getChildren method, check absolutePath
existence method, and check relativePath existence method
  - started the check fileExistence method under the Directory class

What do I plan to do now?
  - add/call corresponding command methods on the shell when the user enters
  - start to plan out the testing with my teammates

Am I blocked on anything?
  - nothing
