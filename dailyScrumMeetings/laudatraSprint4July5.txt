What did I do last time?
  - Updated CRC cards to have one for the new Curl class
  - Brainstormed ideas for the design of the Curl class and researched how to 
    read from a webpage in Java.

What do I plan to do now?
  - Begin implementing the Curl class.
  - Iron out all the different cases of how the Curl command will work,
    along with continue researching webpage reading in Java.

Am I blocked on anything?
  - No, not right now.
