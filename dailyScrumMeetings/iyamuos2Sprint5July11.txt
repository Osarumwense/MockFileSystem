What did I work on last time?
- I updated the CRC cards to contain a Grep class.
- I finished adding the redirection functionality to the Cat command.
- I also modified the Cat command to allow execution on valid files in the input
list when there is an invalid file.

What do I intend on working on ?
- I plan to start code for the Grep command class.

What am I currently blocked on?
- Nothing for now.
