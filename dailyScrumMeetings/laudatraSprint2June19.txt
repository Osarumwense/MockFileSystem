What did I do last time? 
  - implemented file overwriting and file appending methods in the File class
    after coming to an agreement across the group on a final design for the
    File class
  - implemented a make directory method in the Directory class
  - wrote a new class (directoryStack) and accompanying CRC card for the 
    directoryStack class in order to implement the pushd command

What do I plan to do now?
  - write code for appropriate command calls in the Shell class 
  - begin planning for the testing phase of the project, which will be the 
    final sprint

Am I blocked on anything?
  - No, not at the moment
