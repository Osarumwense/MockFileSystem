What did I do last time? 
  - Implemented the entire File class with one of my teammates. 
  - We changed the some of the implmentation of File class later since we
figure out a better solution
  - Make a tiny change of the File crcCards

What do I plan to do now?
  - After some design changes, my partner and I have to redo some of the
methods under file class
  - Start working on ls and pwd commands

Am I blocked on anything?
- The whole team spent a huge amount of time to discuss the design of shell,
interpreter and File class 
- My partner and I have to change the File class after the group discussion.
