what did I do last time?
	- Completed most of the Shell class code, except it cannot take more than
	one command consecutively
	- Finished the history class where the history of inputs are stored

What do I plan to do now?
	- Find and debug the reason as to why the Shell does not work as wanted
	- Start and design the Manual class

Am I blocked on anything?
	- I need the interpreter class to be working in order to completely
	finish the Shell class
