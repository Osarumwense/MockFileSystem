What did I do last time?
  - Finished up Curl class entirely, and made sure all the boundary cases were
    were working as they should.
  - Added a few methods and exception names to list of appropriate exceptions 
    that can be caught.

What do I plan to do now?
  - Begin the formal test cases for my Curl command.
  - Inspect all commands for bugs and make sure they all save in Files

Am I blocked on anything right now?
  - No, not at the moment.
