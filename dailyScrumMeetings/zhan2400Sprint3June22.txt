What did I do last time?
  - discussed and finalized all the program design regarding the details
of the Directory class and File class before the demo demonstration with 
our TA.

What do I plan to do now?
  - create a class for each command
  - adjust the small details inside the current methods,for example return 
a string to the shell instead of printing the message directory under the
class method
  - start the final stage of the assignment which is testing

Am I blocked on anything?
  - No, not at this point
