What did I do last time?
    - worked on printing the current working directory that the user is in to
     the console
    - finalized the project design in collaboration with other team members  

What do I plan to do now?
    - wrap up printing the current working directory and starting writing 
      tests and documentation for it 
    - work on my sprint 2 tasks which are to complete the change directory 
      command and write tests/documentation for it.   

Am I blocked on anything?
   - I currently need a way to access the name of the actual directory using
     our design pattern, so essentially the getDirName method.
