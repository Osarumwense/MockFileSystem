What did I work on last time?
- I made changes to the Cat command to take into consideration the redirection
that the user may possibly want to use.

What do I intend on working on?
- Create a CRC card for the Grep command
- Update Cat CRC card to reflect the redirection implementation
- Start writing code for the Grep class

What am I currently blocked on?
- nothing for now.
