what did I do last time?
	- Implemented Shell class to interact with interpreter when a command is
	received
	- Fixed Shell bugs to work with current implementations
	- Started the Manual class, hope to finish very soon

What do I plan to do now?
	- Complete the Manual class completely 
	- Implement the Manual class to work with the Shell class

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not as of now
