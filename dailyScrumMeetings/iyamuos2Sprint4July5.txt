What did I work on last time?
- I enabled the Cat command print error messages for an invalid filename given
but only that one, while allowing the command to continue execution for other
filenames given in the list.
- I solved the problem of redirecting the error message to the shell console
when an output file is given, while redirecting everything else to the output
file, with the help of a TA.

What do I plan to work on now?
- I plan to implement the solution for printing the error message while
redirecting other output to output files.
- I plan to start basic code for the Grep command class.

What am I currently stuck on?
- Nothing for now.
