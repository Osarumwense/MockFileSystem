What did I work on last time?
- Wrote out complete Pseudocode for the Grep command
- Fixed a bug in Echo that created a new file with the full path name

What do I plan on working on?
- I intend on finishing the Grep command.
- I also intend on writing test cases for the command.

what am I currently stuck on?
- I do not know whether to match the whole line in a file with the given REGEX
in Grep or to match the words in it word by word.
