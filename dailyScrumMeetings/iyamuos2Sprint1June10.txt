what did I word on last time?
- I discussed and decided on the best design for the group to move forward with
- I started on the more detailed implementation for the commands which have
been assigned to me

What do I plan to work on now?
- intend to start writing code for the first command I have been assigned to
work on, that is the exit command. I.E I need to make an exit button for the
shell window
- I also intend on writing exhasutive test cases for the command

What am I stuck on currentlly
- I am having trouble coming up with a way to design the File class in a manner
which does not actually create a new file stored on the computer.
