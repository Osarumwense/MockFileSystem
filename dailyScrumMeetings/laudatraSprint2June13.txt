What did I do last time?
  - worked on finalizing the printing of the current working directory in 
collaboration with another teammate.
  - reworked my sprint 1 tasks, which now consist of making CRC cards for a 
slightly different reworking on our design and designing/implementing the File
class  

What do I plan to do now? 
  - Finish up all of my sprint 1 tasks, including the complete implementation of the
File class.
- Update/create all necessary CRC cards if design requirements need be. 

Am I blocked on anything?
- I'm stuck trying to choose which design would be best for the implementation of
the File class; the nested ArrayList storage method, or the large entirely contained
ArrayList with all files placed in the array with an untraditional form of 
organization, which may help with efficiency.
