What did I do last time?

  - finalized all the details regarding our current implementation and design of
    the Shell class and Directory class prior to the meeting with the TA on  
    June 22nd.
  - added several calls to command methods in different classes in the Shell  
    class in order for Shell to be able to call the appropriate methods once
    it receives ArrayList format information back from the interpreter.

What do I plan to do now?
  -  Make all adjustments to the code based on the advice from the TA,  
     including separating all commands into different classes.
  - start the testing phase of the project (i.e the objective of Sprint 3)

Am I blocked on anything?
  -  No, not right now.
