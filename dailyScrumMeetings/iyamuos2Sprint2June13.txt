what did I work on last time?
- Helped design History class with group members
- Changed CRC cards to include a Directory class as opposed to a Navigator class
- Started and finished writing code for the Interpreter class
- Redesigned the Directory class to possibly make use of a Tree Structure to
represent the MOCK file system

What do I plan to work on now?
- I plan to start writing code for the Directory class
- I plan to complete the pwd command I coudnt do the last Sprint

What am I stuck on currently?
- I need to find a way to import already made Java files into an eclipse project
properly.
