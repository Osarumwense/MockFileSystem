# MockFileSystem
A program to simulate the linux File System
This is a group school project from my software design class. The program simulates the linux file system and the linux shell. I worked on in it a group of four people, using svn, as specified by the assignment instructions. Commands in this project work similarly to the bash commands on ths linux shell.
